FileZilla Log Analyzer 1.10 alpha Change Log file.

1.10 alpha:
ENHANCEMENTS:
	-Can now filter by user, IP address, date, port or any combination thereof.
	-Scrambling by IP address now appropriately scrambles only public IPs. Specifically, those that are not in the following CIDR ranges:
		-127.0.0.1/8 (Loopback addresses)
		-10.0.0.0/8 (Private network)
		-172.16.0.0/12 (Private network)
		-192.168.0.0/16 (Private network)
		-169.254.0.0/16 (Link-local addresses)
	-Scrambling by user can be done in numbered fashion(User_1,User_2,etc.)
	-Flags can be specified much more flexibly, major improvements/changes made to flagHandler module:
		-concise and verbose flags can be specified(-p and --parse respectively)
		-flags that perform similar functions have been consolidated into one:
			-f,u, and i flags are now parameters to the scramble flag(-s, or --scramble)
	-Created help flag which briefly displays all flags and their parameters to command prompt
	-Writing/overwriting is now specified without redundancies (i.e. Writing xxx..., Overwriting xxx...)
BUG FIXES:
	-Made parser recognize message which caused an error to be thrown about file not being an authentic FileZilla Server log
	-Fixed bug that would cause an error when parsing by user instance if selecting portion where user only logs in or disconnects in log file
