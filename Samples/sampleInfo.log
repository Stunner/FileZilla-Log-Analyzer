Creation Info:
##############
	'sampleLog.log' created by using FLA version 1.03 alpha's u, i, and f flags on a real log file(equivalent to FLA version 1.10 alpha's scramble flag with the f, u and i parameters). 'sampleListedSummary.log' and 'sampleLineInterpretation.log' were created by running FLA without flags on 'sampleLog.log'.

####################################
'sampleLineInterpretation.log' Info:
####################################
	This file contains a line by line, easily readable interpretation of each significant action, while filtering out the verbose protocol actions. A line number follows each interpreted line.

'sampleListedSummary.log' Info:

	Times are provided in tuples, or instances, which contain the date, time, and line number, like so: ('4/1/2009', '1:34:49', 13)

                              #instance at which action was completed (in this case, when the file finished being downloaded)

'fail' - indicates when an action is not successfully completed(in this case user benjamin button began downloading file_7.mp3, but did not successfully complete the download for some reason)

Note: Any listing without a 'fail' next to it is successful.
